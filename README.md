Using MS SQL Server 
 Inspired by AlextheAnalyst's video on creating a Data Analytics portfolio (I would recommend checking him out!)

This is a simple data dive into the data behind the Covid-19 cases/deaths/vaccines in different countries. Using data provided by ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths we take a deeper dive into some analysies like:

-Infection percentage as a total of the population per location/country

-Do countires with higher stringency scores (A score based on how quickly they shut down operations and recated to the virus) have less cases as a % of total population

-Did countires with higher lung realted illnesses recieve vaccines first

# Demo-Preview
<!-- Add a demo for your project -->

After you have written about your project, it is a good idea to have a demo/preview(**video/gif/screenshots** are good options) of your project so that people can know what to expect in your project. You could also add the demo in the previous section with the product description.

Here is a random GIF as a placeholder.

# Table of contents

After you have introduced your project, it is a good idea to add a **Table of contents** or **TOC** as **cool** people say it. This would make it easier for people to navigate through your README and find exactly what they are looking for.

Here is a sample TOC(*wow! such cool!*) that is actually the TOC for this README.

- [Project Title](#SQL-Covid-Project)
- [Demo-Preview](#demo-preview)
- [Table of contents](#table-of-contents)
