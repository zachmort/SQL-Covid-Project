This is a simple data dive into the data behind the Covid-19 cases/deaths/vaccines in different countries. Using data provided by ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths we take a deeper dive into some analysies like:

-Infection percentage as a total of the population per location/country

-Do countires with higher stringency scores (A score based on how quickly they shut down operations and recated to the virus) have less cases as a % of total population

-Did countires with higher lung realted illnesses recieve vaccines with prioritization
